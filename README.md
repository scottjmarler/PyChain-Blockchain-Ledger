# Fintech-Challenge_18
Module 18 Challenge



# Module 18 - Blockchain Based Ledger


## Challenge: 

You’ll make the following updates to the provided Python file for this Challenge, which already contains the basic PyChain ledger structure that you created throughout the module:

Create a new data class named Record. This class will serve as the blueprint for the financial transaction records that the blocks of the ledger will store.

Change the existing Block data class by replacing the generic data attribute with a record attribute that’s of type Record.

Create additional user input areas in the Streamlit application. These input areas should collect the relevant information for each financial record that you’ll store in the PyChain ledger.

Test your complete PyChain ledger.

You’ll then upload the Python file for this Challenge to your GitHub repository. Make sure to update the README.md file to include an explanation of the Steamlit application, a screenshot or video of your deployed Streamlit application, and any other information that’s needed to interact with your project.

## Usage


* Open the pychain.py file that your Challenge files include. You’ll use this file to complete the steps for this Challenge. Notice that the PyChain ledger that you built throughout this module already includes the functionality to create blocks, perform the proof of work consensus protocol, and validate blocks in the chain.

* The steps for this Challenge are divided into the following sections:

    * Create a Record Data Class

    * Modify the Existing Block Data Class to Store Record Data

    * Add Relevant User Inputs to the Streamlit Interface

    * Test the PyChain Ledger by Storing Records
